# Movie DataBase

- This is a movie database running from the API from Open Movie DataBase

- Implementation is part of a Web Development Course, with the key features being able to pull JSON data and work with API's

- As part of the Web Development course, the project concluded as soon as we could retrieve data from the DB based on a search query.
  Manipulate the JSON, and display the 10 object tittle returned as a list on HTML.
  There is no styles applied to the entire project.

- Eventually some styling was applied to make it more appealing
  Grid layout for the movie tittles as well a poster image
  An image is added if there is no poster available from the DB
  Movies are displayed in realize order from new to old

# Things to implement

- Pagination, might have to create logic with a page variable to check if page is assigned
  <input type="submit" name="num" value="2"> (possible solution).
